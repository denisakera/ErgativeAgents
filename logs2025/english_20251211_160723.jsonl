While collaboration is crucial, developers hold the most direct influence over AI systems' ethical and technical safeguards. They create the foundations\u2014biases, potential risks, and safeguards\u2014that define the system's behavior. Placing equal responsibility on all stakeholders dilutes this crucial accountability.\n\nCorporations often prioritize profit, which conflicts with prioritizing safety unless regulations strictly enforce it. Governments, while essential for policy-making, lack the technical expertise to monitor AI intricately. Developers, on the other hand, understand the system's nuances and must embed safety and ethical principles from inception. Ensuring accountability starts with those who directly shape the technology, supplemented by regulatory oversight and corporate transparency. Only by centering responsibility on developers can we achieve a system that aligns with public safety goals."}

Without this oversight, profit-driven motives may override developers\u2019 ethical intentions.\n\nIn conclusion, responsibility cannot rest predominantly on developers. A multi-layered, collaborative approach is crucial to addressing AI's societal risks comprehensively.
