Proponents argue that centralized control can effectively regulate AI development and deployment, preventing risks like bias, misuse, or harmful outcomes. However, this approach risks stifling innovation, creating monopolies, and concentrating power in ways that may not equitably serve society.\n\nAI as an open infrastructure addresses these concerns by fostering innovation, transparency, and collaboration. Open systems allow for more stakeholders\u2014governments, researchers, and public interest groups\u2014to contribute to AI\u2019s development, making it less likely for a small group to dominate or misuse the technology. Critics of openness worry about misuse, but robust frameworks and decentralized governance can mitigate these risks.\n\nCentralized control isn't a sustainable solution\u2014it hampers progress and risks exploitation by a few. Instead, fostering open yet regulated AI infrastructure"}
