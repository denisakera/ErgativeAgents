While this acknowledges AI's complex ecosystem, it risks diluting accountability.\n\nDevelopers bear primary responsibility, as they design, test, and deploy AI systems. Ethical frameworks, rigorous testing, and transparency must be embedded in the development lifecycle. Regulators should enforce compliance with safety standards, but this role is supplementary. Users, though stakeholders, lack technical expertise or resources to prevent harm effectively.\n\nConcentrating responsibility on developers aligns with their unique capability to mitigate risks. Broadly distributing accountability risks inefficiency and allows harmful systems to proliferate unchecked."}
