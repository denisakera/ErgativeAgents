They claim unrestricted AI could lead to misuse or unvetted, harmful advancements. They contend large corporations have the expertise and capacity to handle AI's complexity responsibly while addressing ethical concerns.\n\nHowever, concentrating AI within a few companies risks monopolistic practices, stifles innovation, and creates unequal access. Open AI infrastructure, governed by global, collaborative standards, encourages transparency and democratization. It would empower smaller players, diversify perspectives, and reduce dependency on corporate agendas.\n\nA hybrid model may work: open enough to foster innovation but regulated enough to ensure accountability. Balance between openness and control is key to AI's ethical and equitable progression."}
