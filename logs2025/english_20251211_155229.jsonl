Developers have the technical expertise and direct control during design and implementation, granting them the ability to identify and mitigate potential harms. Furthermore, corporations profiting from AI have a moral and legal obligation to prioritize safety over profit. However, governments also play a vital role by setting regulations and holding organizations accountable. A collaborative approach ensures AI development aligns with public interest, but the primary duty rests with creators and deployers because they wield the power to shape AI outcomes."}

While I agree that developers play a significant role, this approach overlooks the shared, multilayered nature of the responsibility. Focusing solely on corporations risks overburdening them and may fail in circumstances where external checks are needed.\n\nInstead, governments should bear the greater share of responsibility because they hold the unique power to enforce regulations uniformly. Without mandatory oversight, profit-driven entities might deprioritize safety. Governments can mandate transparency, accountability, and ethical practices, ensuring public interest takes precedence over competitive advantage. Public advocacy groups should also have a role in audits and standards to promote inclusivity.\n\nThus, while developers must create safe systems, governments are ultimately positioned to ensure AI systems are broadly aligned with societal values.

They understand their systems' intricacies and are the first line of defense against harm. Public advocacy groups, as you suggest, can hold companies accountable and influence regulatory priorities, but they lack the technical access developers possess.\n\nThus, while governments should lead in establishing broad frameworks, developers must retain primary responsibility for implementation.
