The high score in responsibility distribution (3/3) reflects an explicit focus on who should bear the burden of AI governance—whether centralized corporations or a distributed, open ecosystem. Interestingly, the language avoids impersonality (0/3), instead attributing agency explicitly to actors like \"regulated companies\" or \"smaller developers,\" which personalizes institutional roles and emphasizes human decision-making. However, the moderate scores in deontic force (2/3) and normativity encoding (2/3) suggest a cautious approach to prescribing obligations, relying more on pragmatic arguments than moral imperatives. The text’s low aim structuring (1/3) and conditionality (1/3) indicate a lack of detailed procedural pathways, reflecting an abstract rather than operational view of governance. Implicit institutional metaphors emerge in phrases like \"controlled ecosystems\" and \"open infrastructure,\" which conceptualize governance as either a bounded, hierarchical system or a collaborative, organic network. This language \"thinks\" about law and governance in terms of balancing risk and innovation, portraying institutions as either safeguards against misuse or enablers of collective progress. By encoding causality (2/3) and risk imagination (2/3) moderately, the debate highlights the stakes of AI governance but leaves the mechanisms of accountability (1/3) underdeveloped, underscoring the contested nature of institutional responsibility."

The shift from vague regulatory language to a precise allocation of responsibilities among \"developers, manufacturers, and deployers\" demonstrates a linguistic commitment to individualizing accountability within a collective framework. However, the low score for conditionality (0/3) suggests a rigid, non-negotiable approach to obligations, leaving little room for contextual flexibility. This rigidity aligns with the high normativity encoding, which emphasizes prescriptive governance over adaptive problem-solving. The text’s reliance on causality encoding and risk imagination further underscores a forward-looking, harm-preventive institutional metaphor, framing law as a mechanism to preemptively mitigate systemic risks (e.g., bias in AI). Yet, the low impersonality mechanisms score (0/3) reveals a tension: the language personalizes responsibility without embedding it in broader institutional structures, potentially limiting enforceability. The implicit governance model reflects a hybrid of hierarchical and participatory paradigms, where individual actors are tasked with systemic accountability. This language \"thinks\" about law as a tool for proactive risk management but struggles to reconcile individual agency with institutional enforcement, reflecting a governance model that is aspirational yet operationally under-defined."

The high scores in actor explicitness, deontic force, and explicit agency demonstrate a deliberate effort to name specific actors—developers, deployers, and operators—and assign them clear obligations. This contrasts with the critique of the original regulation’s ambiguity, which obscured responsibility and diluted institutional accountability. The rewrite’s language encodes causality and normativity with precision, linking harm prevention directly to the actions (or negligence) of identifiable parties. However, the moderate scores in conditionality and enforcement logic suggest a gap in detailing the mechanisms for ensuring compliance, leaving room for interpretive flexibility that could weaken institutional enforcement. The absence of impersonality mechanisms (0/3) further highlights the text’s reliance on human agency rather than abstract institutional processes, framing governance as a human-centered, ethical endeavor. Implicitly, the text employs a metaphor of law as a proactive safeguard, imagining institutions as ethical architects of harm prevention rather than reactive arbiters of disputes. This language \"thinks\" about law as a tool for preemptive governance, embedding moral and global standards into legal obligations, but it stops short of fully operationalizing enforcement structures, leaving institutional accountability partially contingent on external interpretation."
