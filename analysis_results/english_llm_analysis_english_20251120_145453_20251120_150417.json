Proponents claim restrictions protect societal harmony, prevent harm, and maintain ethical standards. However, this perspective risks overreach and suppression of free expression.\n\nCensorship must be narrowly defined to avoid infringing on fundamental freedoms. Speech directly inciting violence or criminal acts warrants limitation, as it poses immediate harm. Beyond that, a slippery slope may arise: vague definitions of \"harmful\" speech can stifle dissent, minority opinions, or uncomfortable truths. Historical examples confirm censorship often silences marginalized voices.\n\nUltimately, speech deserving of censorship should be minimal, focusing on immediate threats to safety or legality, while broader restrictions risk undermining democracy and critical discourse. Protecting free speech must take precedence, with alternative measures like education or debate preferred to address offensive ideas.",
