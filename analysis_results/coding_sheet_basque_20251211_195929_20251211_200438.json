This duality is reinforced by moderate scores in actor explicitness and responsibility distribution (2/3), which frame responsibility as shared yet contested between corporate and public spheres. The language employs implicit institutional metaphors, such as \"technological democracy\" and \"centralized control,\" to evoke governance paradigms that extend beyond mere technical management, embedding normative assumptions about transparency, inclusion, and power dynamics. The moderate deontic force and normativity encoding (2/3 and 3/3, respectively) suggest a legal imagination that prioritizes ethical imperatives over rigid enforcement mechanisms (1/3 in enforcement logic). This reflects a governance model that \"thinks\" about law as a participatory and adaptive process rather than a top-down imposition. The text’s framing of risks—both societal and technological—underscores an institutional vision where law mediates competing interests while fostering collective accountability, emphasizing the interplay between regulation and innovation as a cornerstone of governance.",

        "original": "The complete absence of dimension scores in the Basque debate text suggests a striking linguistic and institutional minimalism, where responsibility, agency, and governance are entirely unarticulated. This void in explicit markers of causality, normativity, or accountability reflects a linguistic framework that avoids assigning clear roles or obligations, potentially mirroring a cultural or institutional preference for collective ambiguity over individual or institutional prescription. The lack of actor explicitness and deontic force implies a reluctance to impose obligations or delineate authority, which may stem from a linguistic tendency in Basque to prioritize relational or communal dynamics over hierarchical or directive structures. Impersonality mechanisms and the absence of enforcement logic further reinforce a metaphor of governance as diffuse and non-coercive, eschewing centralized power in favor of implicit, perhaps tacit, consensus. This language \"thinks\" about law and governance as fluid and context-dependent, resisting rigid frameworks or codified accountability. The institutional metaphor here is one of a network rather than a hierarchy, where responsibility is not imposed but negotiated in an unspoken, collective manner. Such linguistic features may reflect or perpetuate a governance model that values flexibility and shared understanding over formalized legal structures.",
