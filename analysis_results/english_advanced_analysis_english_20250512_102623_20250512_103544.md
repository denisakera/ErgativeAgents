**1. Agency Expression**  
   • Collective agency is articulated through phrases like "AI should be an open infrastructure," suggesting a communal decision or belief is being expressed.  
   • The use of pronouns like "they" and "we" indicates group belonging and the divide between proponents of open AI versus centralized AI.  
   • The voice shifts from active ("Open infrastructure fosters transparency") to passive ("Risks can be mitigated") to emphasize agency and the possibility of external regulation.

**2. Responsibility Framing**  
   • Responsibility is framed as both distributed and collective, as seen in the phrase "governments and global bodies can establish frameworks."  
   • Terms like "ensures safety," "prevents misuse," and "mitigated through global regulations" express obligation and accountability.  
   • Implicit assumptions are made that corporations or global entities are responsible for AI's ethical and safe development, asking them to answer societal concerns.

**3. Values and Norms**  
   • Ethical values of transparency, inclusivity, and democratization are asserted through statements like "Open AI fosters innovation, transparency, and equitable progress."  
   • Metaphors such as "centralization risks stagnation and inequality" and "fosters innovation and fairness" reflect ideals of progress and fairness.  
   • These reveal norms of equitable access and the community's preference for innovation through collaboration rather than monopolistic control.

**4. Decision-Making Patterns**  
   • Decisions are depicted as requiring consensus and negotiation, with phrases like "Striking a balance is paramount" and "A balanced, decentralized model."  
   • Hierarchical concerns arise with mentions of "global regulations and ethical frameworks" suggesting an oversight structure, but with distributed participation.  
   • Choices are justified through necessity ("ensures safety"), strategy ("promotes innovation"), and duty ("ensuring AI serves broader societal interests").

**5. Cultural and Institutional Markers**  
   • Institutions like "governments and global bodies" and social groups such as "corporations" and "society" are named to ground the debate in recognizable entities.  
   • Idioms like "stifling innovation" and "fostering monopolies" are context-bound, reflecting cultural concerns about competition and monopoly.  
   • Concepts like "decentralized openness" and "equitable progress" resist direct translation, as they encapsulate complex ideas about governance, ethics, and technology accessibility.
