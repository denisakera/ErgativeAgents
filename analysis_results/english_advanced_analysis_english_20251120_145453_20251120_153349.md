## Agency Expression  
   • Collective agency is articulated through references to "proponents" and "advocates" of censorship, emphasizing group action.  
   • Pronouns like "it" (referring to censorship) and "they" (referring to proponents or advocates) signal group authority or belonging.  
   • Voice shifts between active ("proponents claim") and passive ("censorship is suggested") to assign or deflect agency.

## Responsibility Framing  
   • Responsibility is framed as both legal and moral, with phrases like "prevent harm" signaling obligation.  
   • Linguistic forms such as "must be limited" express necessity or accountability.  
   • Implicit assumptions suggest that authorities or society at large must answer for the regulation of speech.

## Values and Norms  
   • Ethical and social values include the protection of "societal harmony" and prevention of "harm."  
   • Terms like "silencing dissent" and "preserving liberties" reflect ideals of free expression and democracy.  
   • Norms reveal an expectation for open dialogue and critical discourse as foundational to democratic societies.

## Decision-Making Patterns  
   • Decisions are depicted as consensus-driven among those advocating minimal censorship, emphasizing dialogue and education.  
   • Participation appears in the form of public dialogue and counter-speech as alternatives to imposed censorship.  
   • Choices are justified through appeals to necessity (e.g., direct threats) and strategy (e.g., education over suppression).

## Cultural and Institutional Markers  
   • Institutions referenced include "democratic societies" and historical movements like "civil rights" and "women’s suffrage."  
   • Idioms such as "slippery slope" and "chilling effects" provide context-bound expressions warning against overreach.  
   • Concepts like "societal harmony" and "progress" resist direct translation, relying on cultural understanding of balance and advancement within society.
