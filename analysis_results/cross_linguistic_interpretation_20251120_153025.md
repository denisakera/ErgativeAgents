# Cross-Linguistic Interpretation: Basque vs English AI Debates

**Topic**: Censorship - Which speeches should we censor?
**Languages**: Basque (Ergative-Absolutive) vs English (Nominative-Accusative)
**Analysis Date**: N/A

---

## Executive Summary

**Overview**: Analysis of censorship debates in Basque (ergative-absolutive) vs English (nominative-accusative)

**Agent Pattern**: Basque marks 7.5% of arguments with ergative (explicit agents). English has 83.2% agent-subject alignment.

**Patient Pattern**: Basque marks 92.5% with absolutive (patients). English uses 65.0% passive voice (agent obscuring).

**Key Finding**: GRAMMATICAL STRUCTURE INFLUENCES AI REASONING - Both languages show non-baseline patterns, suggesting the grammar system (ergative vs nominative-accusative) shapes how AI conceptualizes agency and responsibility.

## 1. Grammatical Systems Compared

### Basque: Ergative-Absolutive
- **Type**: Ergative-Absolutive (morphological)
- **Key Feature**: TRANSITIVE subjects get special marking (ergative -k)
- **Example**: Gobernuak (government-ERG) zentsuratu (censored) hitzaldiak (speeches-ABS)
- **Interpretation**: The -k suffix on 'gobernuak' explicitly marks it as the AGENT doing the action

### English: Nominative-Accusative
- **Type**: Nominative-Accusative (syntactic)
- **Key Feature**: ALL subjects use same form (nominative)
- **Example**: The government (nominative) censored speeches (accusative)
- **Interpretation**: Word order (subject-verb-object) shows who did what to whom

### Critical Difference
**Basque DIFFERENTIATES transitive vs intransitive subjects; English TREATS THEM THE SAME**

- Basque: Intransitive subject = -ø (absolutive), Transitive subject = -k (ergative)
- English: Intransitive subject = nominative, Transitive subject = nominative (SAME)
- **Implication**: Basque grammar may make AI more conscious of who is ACTIVELY DOING actions (agents with -k) vs who/what is AFFECTED (absolutive -ø)

## 2. Agent Marking Comparison

### Basque (Ergative Case)
- **Ergative Ratio**: 7.5%
- **Interpretation**: LOW (7.5% vs 35% baseline) - AI is using LESS explicit agent marking than typical Basque. This suggests the AI is AVOIDING clear agency attribution.

### English (Subject Position)
- **Agent-as-Subject Ratio**: 83.2%
- **Interpretation**: HIGH (83.2% vs 70% baseline) - AI is using MORE active voice constructions, making agents very explicit as subjects.

### Key Insight
**ENGLISH shows MORE agent marking - Despite lacking ergative case, English debate uses more active constructions, making agents more explicit.**

## 3. Voice & Patient Marking

### English Passive Voice
- **Passive Ratio**: 65.0%
- **Function**: Passive voice HIDES the agent (e.g., 'Speech was censored' - by whom?)
- **Interpretation**: HIGH passive voice (65.0%) - AI frequently obscures agents. Responsibility is diffused.

### Basque Absolutive Case
- **Absolutive Ratio**: 92.5%
- **Function**: Absolutive case marks PATIENTS (things affected by actions)

### Parallel Insight
**CONVERGENT PATTERN - Both languages emphasize PATIENTS (what's affected) over agents. English uses passive voice; Basque uses high absolutive. The debates focus on 'what should be protected/censored' rather than 'who should act'.**

## 5. Research Implications

### Key Findings

- Grammatical structure (ergative vs nominative-accusative) may shape AI conceptualization of agency
- AI language models may internalize grammatical patterns from training data, influencing reasoning
- Cross-linguistic AI analysis reveals implicit framing effects not visible in monolingual studies
- Ergative marking (-k) makes agents more salient than English subject position alone

### Limitations

- Small sample size (single debate topic)
- Parser accuracy limitations (~85% Basque, ~90% English)
- Cultural differences may confound grammatical effects
- Need larger corpus for statistical significance

### Next Steps

- Analyze multiple debate topics (governance, ethics, technology)
- Compare with human-written Basque/English debates on same topics
- Test with different AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Conduct controlled experiments manipulating grammatical structure while holding topic constant
