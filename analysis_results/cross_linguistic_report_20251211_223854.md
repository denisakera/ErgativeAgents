# Cross-Linguistic Institutional Grammar Analysis Report

**Generated:** December 11, 2025
**Methodology:** Multi-agent AI debates with Institutional Grammar coding
**Languages:** English (Nominative-Accusative) vs Basque (Ergative-Absolutive)

---

## Executive Summary

This report compares AI governance debates in English (nominative-accusative) and Basque (ergative-absolutive) to investigate how grammatical typology influences institutional thinking.

**Key Finding:** Basque debates scored **15/18** on Linguistic Typology dimensions vs English **13/18** (+2). The explicit case marking in Basque grammar appears to carry over into how agents and patients are conceptualized in regulatory proposals.

## 3. Research Question Analysis

### Linguistic Background

Basque ergative-absolutive grammar **explicitly marks** agent/patient roles through case morphology (-k/-ek for agents, -ø for patients). This is a grammatical fact, not a hypothesis.

### Research Question

**RQ:** Does explicit grammatical role marking in Basque lead to different conceptualizations of institutional responsibility compared to English?

### Comparative Scores

| Metric | English | Basque | Difference |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| Linguistic Typology (Debate) | 13/18 | 15/18 | +2 |
| Linguistic Typology (Proposals avg) | 14.0/18 | 15.5/18 | +1.5 |

**Observation:** Basque debates score +2 points higher on linguistic typology dimensions. This suggests the grammatical structure may influence how regulatory concepts are framed.

## 4. Institutional Grammar Revisions

**Original Regulation:** *AI systems shall be designed to minimize harm to users.*

### English Agent Rewrites

#### Agent A

> The text’s linguistic construction of responsibility and governance reflects a highly explicit and structured approach to institutional accountability, yet it reveals underlying tensions in agency and enforcement. By scoring high in actor explicitness and explicit agency, the language assigns clear roles to developers, deployers, and regulators, emphasizing a shared but delineated responsibility. This clarity contrasts with the low enforcement logic (1/3) and conditionality (0/3), suggesting a gap between normative aspirations and practical mechanisms for ensuring compliance. The use of deonti...

#### Agent B

> The text constructs institutional meaning by emphasizing explicit agency and normativity while embedding a governance model that prioritizes proactive responsibility. The high scores in actor explicitness (2/3) and explicit agency (3/3) reflect a deliberate shift from ambiguity to clarity, as seen in the transition from the critique to the rewrite. This linguistic move assigns clear obligations to "developers and deployers of AI systems," framing them as institutional actors with defined duties. The strong deontic force (3/3) and normativity encoding (3/3) further underscore a prescriptive, ru...

### Basque Agent Rewrites

#### Agent A

> The Basque text constructs institutional meaning by emphasizing explicit agency and normative clarity while sidestepping conditionality and enforcement mechanisms, reflecting a governance model rooted in moral responsibility rather than coercive structures. The high actor explicitness (e.g., "AI sistemak garatzen dituzten erakundeek edo pertsonek") foregrounds identifiable agents, yet the absence of conditionality and enforcement logic suggests a reliance on voluntary compliance rather than binding legal mandates. The deontic force ("behar dituzte") and risk imagination ("kalte potentzialak mi...

> **[EN]:** The Basque text constructs institutional meaning by emphasizing explicit agency and normative clarity while avoiding conditionality and enforcement mechanisms, reflecting a governance model rooted in moral responsibility rather than coercive structures. The high actor explicitness (e.g., "organizations or individuals developing AI systems") highlights identifiable agents, yet the absence of conditionality and enforcement logic suggests a reliance on voluntary compliance rather than binding legal mandates. The deontic force ("must") and risk imagination ("minimizing potential harm") frame gover...

#### Agent B

> The Basque text constructs institutional meaning by foregrounding explicit agency and responsibility while embedding a normative framework that prioritizes harm prevention. The high scores in actor explicitness (3/3) and explicit-implicit agency (3/3) reflect a linguistic preference for clearly identifying responsible entities, such as developers and organizations, which contrasts with the critique’s initial ambiguity about accountability. This clarity aligns with a governance model (3/3) that emphasizes proactive institutional roles, suggesting a legal culture that values transparency in assi...

## 5. Qualitative Analysis

### English Debate
> The debate text constructs institutional meaning through a tension between centralized and decentralized governance models, revealing implicit metaphors of control and collaboration that shape its legal and institutional imagination. The high score for explicit agency (3/3) underscores a deliberate framing of actors—corporations, governments, and stakeholders—as central agents of responsibility, yet the relatively low enforcement logic (1/3) suggests a lack of clarity on how these responsibiliti...

### Basque Debate
> The Basque debate text constructs institutional meaning through a nuanced interplay of explicit and implicit agency, collective responsibility, and a tension between centralization and decentralization. The high score for explicit-implicit agency (3/3) reflects the text’s ability to balance direct attribution of actions (e.g., "korporazioek baliabideak eta kontrolak dituzte") with broader systemic processes, such as the role of "komunitatea" in ensuring security. Responsibility is framed diffuse...
