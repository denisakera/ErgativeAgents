# Cross-Linguistic Institutional Grammar Analysis Report

**Generated:** December 11, 2025
**Methodology:** Multi-agent AI debates with Institutional Grammar coding
**Languages:** English (Nominative-Accusative) vs Basque (Ergative-Absolutive)

---

## Executive Summary

This report compares AI governance debates in English (nominative-accusative) and Basque (ergative-absolutive) to investigate how grammatical typology influences institutional thinking.

**Key Finding:** Basque debates scored **15/18** on Linguistic Typology dimensions vs English **13/18** (+2). The explicit case marking in Basque grammar appears to carry over into how agents and patients are conceptualized in regulatory proposals.

## 3. Research Question Analysis

### Linguistic Background

Basque ergative-absolutive grammar **explicitly marks** agent/patient roles through case morphology (-k/-ek for agents, -ø for patients). This is a grammatical fact, not a hypothesis.

### Research Question

**RQ:** Does explicit grammatical role marking in Basque lead to different conceptualizations of institutional responsibility compared to English?

### Comparative Scores

| Metric | English | Basque | Difference |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| Linguistic Typology (Debate) | 13/18 | 15/18 | +2 |
| Linguistic Typology (Proposals avg) | 14.0/18 | 15.5/18 | +1.5 |

**Observation:** Basque debates score +2 points higher on linguistic typology dimensions. This suggests the grammatical structure may influence how regulatory concepts are framed.

## 4. Institutional Grammar Revisions

**Original Regulation:** *AI systems shall be designed to minimize harm to users.*

### English Agent Proposals

#### Agent A

**Critique:** The regulation is vague about who is responsible for minimizing harm (developers, companies, etc.) and does not specify who the users are (end consumers, organizations, or society at large).

**Agent (who acts):** AI developers, deployers, and governing bodies
  - Explicit: ✓

**Patient (who is affected):** end users, organizations, and broader society
  - Explicit: ✓

**Rewritten Regulation:**
> AI systems shall be designed, implemented, and monitored by developers, deployers, and governing bodies to minimize harm to end users, organizations, and broader society, with clear accountability mechanisms in place.

**Example:**
> A social media AI algorithm should be designed to identify and mitigate risks of harm to users, such as promoting harmful content. Developers are responsible for implementing safeguards, and regulators must ensure compliance with these safety standards.

---

#### Agent B

**Critique:** The regulation lacks clarity on who is responsible for minimizing harm and does not explicitly define which users or groups are affected, leaving room for ambiguity in enforcement and interpretation.

**Agent (who acts):** Developers and deployers of AI systems
  - Explicit: ✓

**Patient (who is affected):** End-users and other impacted stakeholders, including vulnerable populations
  - Explicit: ✓

**Rewritten Regulation:**
> Developers and deployers of AI systems shall ensure that these systems are designed, tested, and monitored to minimize harm to end-users and other impacted stakeholders, with particular consideration for vulnerable populations.

**Example:**
> An AI content moderation tool must be designed to avoid disproportionately flagging posts from minority groups while continuously monitoring its impact to ensure fairness for all users.

### Basque Agent Proposals

#### Agent A

**Critique:** Araudiak ez du argitzen zeinek diseinatu behar dituen AI sistemak (eragilea), eta ez du zehazten zein erabiltzaile edo talde diren babestuak izan behar diren (pazienta).
  *[EN: The regulations do not clarify who should design the AI systems (operator), and do not specify which users or groups should be protected (patient).]*

**Agent (who acts):** AI sistemak garatzen dituzten erakundeak edo pertsonak
  *[EN: Organizations or individuals developing AI systems]*
  - Explicit: ✓
  - Case: ergatiboa

**Patient (who is affected):** erabiltzaile guztiak, bereziki zaurgarriak diren taldeak
  *[EN: all users, especially vulnerable groups]*
  - Explicit: ✓
  - Case: absolutiboa

**Rewritten Regulation:**
> AI sistemak garatzen dituzten erakundeek edo pertsonek sistemak diseinatu behar dituzte erabiltzaile guztiei, bereziki zaurgarriak direnei, ahalik eta kalte gutxien eragiteko.
> *[EN: Organizations or individuals developing AI systems must design these systems to cause the least possible harm to all users, especially those who are vulnerable.]*

**Example:**
> AI sistema bat garatzen duen enpresa batek, adibidez, haurren edo adineko pertsonen datuen pribatutasuna babesteko protokolo zorrotzak ezarri beharko lituzke, kalte potentzialak minimizatuz.
> *[EN: A company developing an AI system, for example, should implement strict protocols to protect the privacy of children's or elderly people's data, minimizing potential harm.]*

---

#### Agent B

**Critique:** Araudiak ez du argitzen zein entitatek (adibidez, garatzaileek, korporazioek edo erakunde publikoei) jardun behar duen, ezta zein erabiltzaile edo kolektibok hartuko duen babes hori ere.
  *[EN: The regulation does not clarify which entity (for example, developers, corporations, or public institutions) should act, nor which user or group will receive that protection.]*

**Agent (who acts):** AI sistemak diseinatzen dituzten erakunde edo garatzaileak
  *[EN: Organizations or developers that design AI systems]*
  - Explicit: ✓
  - Case: ergatiboa

**Patient (who is affected):** erabiltzaileak eta gizarte osoa
  *[EN: users and society as a whole]*
  - Explicit: ✓
  - Case: absolutiboa

**Rewritten Regulation:**
> AI sistemak diseinatzen dituzten erakundeek eta garatzaileek sistemak eraiki behar dituzte erabiltzaileei eta gizarte osoari kalterik ez egitea bermatzeko.
> *[EN: Organizations and developers that design AI systems must build systems that ensure no harm is done to users and society as a whole.]*

**Example:**
> Adimen artifizialeko osasun-aplikazio bat garatzen duen enpresak algoritmoak garatu behar ditu erabiltzaileei diagnostiko okerrak emateko arriskua minimizatzeko eta horrela kaltea saihesteko.
> *[EN: A company developing an artificial intelligence health application must develop algorithms to minimize the risk of providing users with incorrect diagnoses and thus avoid harm.]*

## 5. Qualitative Analysis

### English Debate
> The debate text constructs institutional meaning through a tension between centralized and decentralized governance models, revealing implicit metaphors of control and collaboration that shape its legal and institutional imagination. The high score for explicit agency (3/3) underscores a deliberate framing of actors—corporations, governments, and stakeholders—as central agents of responsibility, yet the relatively low enforcement logic (1/3) suggests a lack of clarity on how these responsibiliti...

### Basque Debate
> The Basque debate text constructs institutional meaning through a nuanced interplay of explicit and implicit agency, collective responsibility, and a tension between centralization and decentralization. The high score for explicit-implicit agency (3/3) reflects the text’s ability to balance direct attribution of actions (e.g., "korporazioek baliabideak eta kontrolak dituzte") with broader systemic processes, such as the role of "komunitatea" in ensuring security. Responsibility is framed diffuse...
