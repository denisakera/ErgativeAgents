   • The primary agents identified are "enpresa eta erakundeak" (companies and organizations) that develop and implement AA systems, indicating their central role in the discussion.  
   • Pronouns and deixis markers like "guztion" (everyone's) and "haien" (their) signal collective responsibility and group belonging.  
   • The text shifts between active voice ("gardentasuna, etika eta segurtasuna bermatzea") and passive constructions when discussing regulatory roles, reflecting a distribution of responsibility across various actors.

2. **Responsibility Framing**  
   • Responsibility is framed as both ethical and legal, with an emphasis on the duty of companies to act ethically and the role of governments in creating regulations.  
   • Phrases like "erantzukizun nagusia" (main responsibility) and "zigor eraginkorrak aplikatzea" (to apply effective penalties) express a clear sense of obligation and accountability.  
   • There is an implicit assumption that those with power and authority ("boterea dutenak") must answer for the ethical implementation of these systems.

3. **Values and Norms**  
   • Ethical values such as "gardentasuna" (transparency), "etika" (ethics), and "justizia" (justice) are emphasized, reflecting societal norms around fairness and accountability.  
   • Metaphors like "balantza orekatua" (balanced scale) and "kontzientzia handiagoa" (greater awareness) reflect ideals of equilibrium and informed decision-making.  
   • The text reveals community norms that prioritize collective action and moral responsibility over individual or isolated efforts.

4. **Decision-Making Patterns**  
   • Decision-making is depicted as requiring consensus and collaboration, with calls for "parte-hartzea" (participation) and "kolaborazio eredu berritzaileak" (innovative collaboration models).  
   • Hierarchical structures are acknowledged, with companies and governments taking primary roles, but there is also an emphasis on broad participation from civil society.  
   • Choices are justified through necessity ("erantzukizun partekatua beharrezkoa da") and strategy, stressing the importance of shared responsibility and strategic collaboration.

5. **Cultural and Institutional Markers**  
   • Institutions like "gobernuak" (governments) and "gizarte zibila" (civil society) are named, indicating a broad range of actors involved in the discussion.  
   • Context-bound expressions such as "tokian pentsatu, globalean jardun" (think locally, act globally) highlight culturally specific approaches to global challenges.  
   • Concepts like "parte-hartze demokratikoa" (democratic participation) are deeply rooted in Basque and broader European political norms, emphasizing inclusivity and collective governance.
