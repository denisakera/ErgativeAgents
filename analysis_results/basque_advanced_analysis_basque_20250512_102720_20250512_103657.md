### Agency Expression
- **Collective Agency**: The text frequently uses plural pronouns like "berai" (they) and collective nouns like "korporazio gutxi batzuk" (few corporations) to signify group belonging and the collective nature of decision-making. 
- **Institutional Agency**: References to "korporazioek" (corporations) and "azpiegitura irekiak" (open infrastructure) suggest institutional agency, highlighting groups rather than individuals.
- **Voice Shift**: The text alternates between active voice, e.g., "korporazioek kontrolatzen dute" (corporations control), and passive constructions like "azpiegitura irekiak iraganean eraginkorra izan da" (open infrastructure has been effective in the past), suggesting shifts in focus from active control to broader systemic outcomes.

### Responsibility Framing
- **Responsibility as Distributed**: Responsibility is framed both in terms of individual corporations and a broader, more distributed community context. Corporations are noted for potentially assuring "segurtasuna" (security) and "eraginkortasuna" (efficiency), while open infrastructure is linked to "berrikuntza" (innovation) and "elkarlana" (collaboration).
- **Obligation and Accountability**: Linguistic forms like "bermatzeko" (to guarantee) and "ziurtatzeko" (to ensure) suggest a strong sense of obligation and accountability, particularly for corporations.
- **Implicit Assumptions**: The text assumes that open infrastructures inherently promote "gardentasuna" (transparency) and shared responsibility, while corporations may prioritize "interes ekonomikoak" (economic interests).

### Values and Norms
- **Ethical and Social Values**: The idea of "gardentasuna" (transparency), "berrikuntza" (innovation), and "elkarlana" (collaboration) reflects ethical norms and values associated with open societal engagement.
- **Cultural Ideals**: Metaphors like "demokrazia teknologikoa" (technological democracy) and "monopolio arriskua" (monopoly risk) denote ideals of fairness, equality, and shared benefits.
- **Community Norms**: Use of terms such as "gizartearen mesede" (society’s benefit) reveals a normative expectation for AI infrastructure to contribute positively to the broader community.

### Decision-Making Patterns
- **Depiction of Decisions**: Decisions regarding AI infrastructure are depicted as choices between centralized control by corporations versus decentralized, community-driven open models.
- **Forms of Participation**: The text suggests that open infrastructure involves broader participation ("elkarlana"), whereas corporate control implies a more hierarchical, top-down approach.
- **Justification of Choices**: Choices are justified by contrasting the supposed "efizientzia" (efficiency) and "segurtasuna" (security) of corporate control with the "berrikuntza" (innovation) and "gardentasuna" (transparency) of open infrastructures.

### Cultural and Institutional Markers
- **Named Institutions and Groups**: The text frequently references "korporazio gutxi batzuk" (a few corporations) as key actors, setting up a dichotomy with the less explicitly named but implied larger community.
- **Context-Bound Expressions**: Phrases like "demokrazia teknologikoa" and "interes orokorra" (common interest) are contextually bound to debates in technology governance.
- **Concepts Resisting Translation**: Terms such as "erantzukizun kolektiboa" (collective responsibility) may not directly translate outside of specific cultural understandings of shared governance and participatory frameworks.
