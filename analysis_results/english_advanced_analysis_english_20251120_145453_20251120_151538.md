1. **Agency Expression**  
   • Collective agency is articulated through references to "proponents" and "advocates" of censorship, indicating groups with shared beliefs.  
   • The pronouns "it" and "they" signify the collective arguments or actions associated with censorship, suggesting institutional or group authority.  
   • The text alternates between active voice ("censorship risks becoming a tool of oppression") and passive voice ("censored movements were pivotal"), reflecting shifts from agency to historical outcomes.

2. **Responsibility Framing**  
   • Responsibility is framed as both moral and legal, with implications that authorities might misuse censorship to silence dissent.  
   • Obligation and accountability are expressed through terms like "must be limited" and "should be countered," indicating a necessity to address speech without overreach.  
   • Implicit assumptions suggest that authorities or governments are primarily responsible for defining and implementing censorship, with the risk of suppressing freedoms.

3. **Values and Norms**  
   • The ethical value of free speech as foundational to democracy is strongly asserted.  
   • Terms like "societal harmony," "liberty," and "democracy" reflect culturally specific ideals of Western democratic norms.  
   • The text reveals community norms centered around protecting free expression and encouraging open dialogue through mentions of "education" and "debate."

4. **Decision-Making Patterns**  
   • Decisions around speech censorship are depicted as primarily imposed by authorities, with risks of subjective enforcement.  
   • Participation through public dialogue and counter-speech is emphasized as a democratic approach to handling offensive ideas.  
   • Choices are justified by necessity to prevent harm or maintain freedoms, with strategy focusing on dialogue and education rather than suppression.

5. **Cultural and Institutional Markers**  
   • Institutions implied include government bodies responsible for enforcing censorship laws.  
   • Expressions like "chilling effects," "silencing dissent," and "stifling progress" are context-bound, reflecting concerns prevalent in democratic societies.  
   • Concepts such as "harm" and "societal cohesion" may resist direct translation, as their interpretation is culturally contingent on societal values and norms.
