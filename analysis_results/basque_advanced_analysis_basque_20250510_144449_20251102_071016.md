### Agency Expression
- Collective agency is articulated through expressions like "korporazio batzuek adierazten dute" (some corporations state) and "AA azpiegitura" (AI infrastructure).
- The use of deixis markers like "hau da," "horrek," and "azpiegitura irekia" indicates reference to previously mentioned concepts or the debate's focal points, signaling authority and group belonging.
- The voice shifts between active and passive, such as when discussing centralized control ("mantentzeak espezializazioa bermatzen duela") versus open infrastructure ("azpiegitura irekiak berrikuntza demokratizatzen du").

### Responsibility Framing
- Responsibility is framed both as a technical necessity ("eraginkortasuna bermatzeko") and a moral/legal obligation ("baliabideen erabilera eraginkorra," "gardentasuna sustatuko lirateke").
- Linguistic forms like "behar du" and "ahalbidetu dezake" express obligation and potential accountability.
- Implicit assumptions suggest that corporations have a responsibility to manage AI ethically, while society has a stake in ensuring transparency and collective benefit.

### Values and Norms
- Ethical values are asserted, such as transparency ("gardentasun"), inclusivity ("inklusio"), and collective benefit ("guztion onurarako").
- Metaphors of balance ("oreka hobea") and innovation as a democratizing force ("berrikuntza demokratikoa") reflect culturally specific ideals of fairness and equity.
- Community norms are revealed through the emphasis on shared oversight and participation, suggesting a preference for democratic governance.

### Decision-Making Patterns
- Decisions are depicted as requiring a balance between centralized efficiency and decentralized innovation ("oreka aurkitzea").
- Forms of participation and hierarchy are discussed, with open infrastructure allowing for broader community involvement ("komunitate zabalak erabakiak hartzeko aukera").
- Choices are justified through a mix of necessity ("eraginkortasuna bermatzeko"), duty to society ("gizarte osoaren mesedetan"), and strategic benefits ("baliabideen erabilera eraginkorra").

### Cultural and Institutional Markers
- Institutions like "korporazioak" (corporations) and concepts such as "adimen artifiziala" (artificial intelligence) are named.
- Idioms like "guztion mesedetan" (for the benefit of all) and context-bound expressions like "demokrazia teknologikoa" reveal a cultural emphasis on collective welfare and transparency.
- Concepts like "berrikuntza demokratikoa" and "justizia digitala" may resist direct translation, as they encapsulate culturally specific ideas about technology's role in society.
