## Agency Expression
- **Collective or Institutional Agency**: The text frequently uses the term "proponents" to refer to groups advocating for specific AI governance models. The framing creates a sense of collective agency around both controlled and open AI infrastructures.
- **Pronouns and Deixis Markers**: The repeated use of "they" and "advocates" in phrases like "advocates of controlled AI" signals group belonging and positions these groups with authoritative voices.
- **Voice Shifts**: The text alternates between active and passive voice. Active voice is used when discussing positive outcomes of open AI, such as "open infrastructure fosters innovation," while passive constructions appear in critiques of centralized control, like "this approach risks monopolizing AI's benefits."

## Responsibility Framing
- **Responsibility Framing**: Responsibility is framed as both a technical and moral issue. Technical responsibility is implied through references to "safety" and "regulation," while moral responsibility is embedded in the concern for societal welfare.
- **Linguistic Forms of Obligation**: Modal verbs like "should" and "can" are used to express obligations and potential actions, e.g., "can manage safety concerns without centralized control."
- **Implicit Assumptions**: There is an assumption that corporations inherently prioritize profit over public interest, suggesting they must answer to this imbalance.

## Values and Norms
- **Ethical and Social Values**: Values such as "safety," "accountability," "transparency," and "equitable access" are central, reflecting both ethical and social norms within the tech community.
- **Culturally Specific Ideals**: Terms like "monopolistic control" and "democratizes access" reflect ideals of fairness and competition, deeply rooted in Western economic and political thought.
- **Community Norms**: The text upholds the norm that technology should serve public interest, highlighting a tension between innovation and control.

## Decision-Making Patterns
- **Depicted Decision-Making**: Decision-making is portrayed as a choice between consensus-driven, community-led governance and hierarchical, corporate control.
- **Participation, Hierarchy, and Negotiation**: The text favors decentralized participation, emphasizing "community-driven governance" over centralized decision-making hierarchies.
- **Justification of Choices**: Choices are justified by appealing to necessity (ensuring safety) and strategy (fostering innovation and fairness).

## Cultural and Institutional Markers
- **Named Institutions and Actors**: While specific companies are not named, "corporations" and "community" serve as proxies for various actors within the AI governance debate.
- **Idioms and Context-Bound Expressions**: Phrases like "stifles innovation" and "fosters collaboration" are idiomatic expressions that resonate with discourse in technology policy and business.
- **Concepts Resisting Translation**: The concept of "community-driven governance" may not translate directly into contexts where hierarchical governance models are the norm, highlighting a culturally specific approach to managing technology.
