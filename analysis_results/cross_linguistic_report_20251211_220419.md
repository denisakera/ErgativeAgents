# Cross-Linguistic Institutional Grammar Analysis Report

**Generated:** December 11, 2025
**Methodology:** Multi-agent AI debates with Institutional Grammar coding
**Languages:** English (Nominative-Accusative) vs Basque (Ergative-Absolutive)

---

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes how linguistic typology influences the expression of institutional norms in AI governance debates.

**Key Finding:** Basque demonstrates **higher Linguistic Typology scores** (15/18 vs 11/18), supporting the hypothesis that ergative-absolutive languages make grammatical roles more explicit.

## 2. Hypothesis Testing Results

### Primary Hypothesis

**H1:** Ergative-absolutive languages (Basque) produce more explicit grammatical role marking than nominative-accusative languages (English) in institutional grammar contexts.

| Metric | English | Basque | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Linguistic Typology (Debate) | 11/18 | **15/18** | ✅ Supported |
| Linguistic Typology (Proposals avg) | 14.0/18 | **15.5/18** | ✅ Supported |

**Conclusion:** The hypothesis is **supported**. Basque scores higher on linguistic typology dimensions by +4 points at the debate level.

## 3. Qualitative Analysis

### English Debate
> The debate text reveals a tension between centralization and decentralization in AI governance, framed through implicit institutional metaphors of "control" versus "openness." The high explicitness of agency (3/3) ensures that actors like corporations, governments, and "bad actors" are clearly identified, yet the low scores for responsibility distribution (1/3) and accountability models (1/3) suggest a limited exploration of how these entities share or enforce obligations. The language construct...

### Basque Debate
> The Basque debate text constructs institutional meaning through a tension between centralized and decentralized governance models, reflecting broader concerns about power, equity, and collective responsibility. The high explicitness of agency (3/3) ensures that actors like "korporazioak" (corporations) and "komunitate globala" (global community) are clearly identified, framing responsibility as a contest between institutional actors rather than abstract systems. However, the low responsibility d...
