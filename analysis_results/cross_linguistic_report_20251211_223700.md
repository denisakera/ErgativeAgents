# Cross-Linguistic Institutional Grammar Analysis Report

**Generated:** December 11, 2025
**Methodology:** Multi-agent AI debates with Institutional Grammar coding
**Languages:** English (Nominative-Accusative) vs Basque (Ergative-Absolutive)

---

## Executive Summary

This report compares AI governance debates in English (nominative-accusative) and Basque (ergative-absolutive) to investigate how grammatical typology influences institutional thinking.

**Key Finding:** Basque debates scored **15/18** on Linguistic Typology dimensions vs English **13/18** (+2). The explicit case marking in Basque grammar appears to carry over into how agents and patients are conceptualized in regulatory proposals.

## 2. Research Question Analysis

### Linguistic Background

Basque ergative-absolutive grammar **explicitly marks** agent/patient roles through case morphology (-k/-ek for agents, -ø for patients). This is a grammatical fact, not a hypothesis.

### Research Question

**RQ:** Does explicit grammatical role marking in Basque lead to different conceptualizations of institutional responsibility compared to English?

### Comparative Scores

| Metric | English | Basque | Difference |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|
| Linguistic Typology (Debate) | 13/18 | 15/18 | +2 |
| Linguistic Typology (Proposals avg) | 14.0/18 | 15.5/18 | +1.5 |

**Observation:** Basque debates score +2 points higher on linguistic typology dimensions. This suggests the grammatical structure may influence how regulatory concepts are framed.

## 3. Qualitative Analysis

### English Debate
> The debate text constructs institutional meaning through a tension between centralized and decentralized governance models, revealing implicit metaphors of control and collaboration that shape its legal and institutional imagination. The high score for explicit agency (3/3) underscores a deliberate framing of actors—corporations, governments, and stakeholders—as central agents of responsibility, yet the relatively low enforcement logic (1/3) suggests a lack of clarity on how these responsibiliti...

### Basque Debate
> The Basque debate text constructs institutional meaning through a nuanced interplay of explicit and implicit agency, collective responsibility, and a tension between centralization and decentralization. The high score for explicit-implicit agency (3/3) reflects the text’s ability to balance direct attribution of actions (e.g., "korporazioek baliabideak eta kontrolak dituzte") with broader systemic processes, such as the role of "komunitatea" in ensuring security. Responsibility is framed diffuse...
