1. Agency Expression
   - The text articulates institutional agency through references to "gizarte demokratikoetan" (democratic societies), which implies a collective entity responsible for upholding freedom of speech.
   - The pronouns and deixis markers such as "adibidez" (for example) and "horren ordez" (instead) indicate a shift from specific to general instances or alternatives, showcasing an argumentative structure.
   - Active voice appears when discussing actions like "kontrolatu behar dira" (must be controlled), while passive voice is used for broader assertions, such as "zentsura gehiegizkoa arriskutsua da" (excessive censorship is dangerous).

2. Responsibility Framing
   - Responsibility is framed as moral and social, emphasizing the protection of "gizarte osasuntsua" (a healthy society) and "gizarte plural eta sendo bat" (a plural and strong society).
   - Obligations are expressed through necessity and advisability, with verbs like "mugatu behar dira" (must be limited) and "sustatu behar dira" (should be promoted).
   - There is an implicit assumption that democratic institutions or society at large must decide on the limits of censorship, as evidenced by the concern over "nork erabakitzen duen" (who decides).

3. Values and Norms
   - Ethical values of freedom ("askatasuna") and security ("segurtasuna") are central, highlighting their importance in democratic ideals.
   - The metaphor of "oreka" (balance) reflects a cultural ideal of equilibrium between competing values.
   - Norms of democratic discourse are revealed in the emphasis on "eztabaida askea" (free debate) and "elkarrizketa irekiak" (open dialogues), signifying a community norm favoring dialogue over suppression.

4. Decision-Making Patterns
   - Decisions are depicted as requiring careful balance and rational deliberation, seen in the repeated call for "oreka mantendu behar da" (balance must be maintained).
   - Hierarchical decision-making appears in concerns about "nork erabakitzen duen" (who decides), implying authority figures or institutions are responsible.
   - Justifications for decisions are often necessity-based, such as preventing "indarkeria" (violence) and "gorrotoa" (hate), alongside strategic considerations like fostering "elkarrizketa" (dialogue).

5. Cultural and Institutional Markers
   - Institutions like "gizarte demokratikoetan" (democratic societies) and "hezkuntza" (education) are named, indicating their roles in the discourse.
   - Idiomatic expressions such as "oreka delikatua da" (it is a delicate balance) are context-bound, reflecting the nuanced debate on censorship.
   - Concepts like "zentsura" (censorship) and "adierazpen askatasuna" (freedom of expression) resist direct translation without cultural and political contextualization, as they carry specific historical and societal connotations.
