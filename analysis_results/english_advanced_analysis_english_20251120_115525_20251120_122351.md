1. Agency Expression  
   • The agency is often attributed to "pro-censorship advocates" who are described as aiming to prevent harm ("Pro-censorship advocates often argue it prevents harm").  
   • The text frequently uses the pronoun "it" to refer to censorship as an entity or concept with potential agency ("Censorship advocates often claim it prevents harm").  
   • Shifts between active voice when discussing censorship advocates' intentions and passive voice when discussing censorship's effects ("Censorship has often silenced essential dissent").  

2. Responsibility Framing  
   • Responsibility is framed as a moral issue, questioning who has the legitimate authority to determine harmful speech ("Who decides what’s harmful, and how do we avoid bias?").  
   • The text uses rhetorical questions to highlight the difficulty in assigning accountability and the potential misuse of power ("Who decides what is harmful?").  
   • Implicit assumptions are made that censorship authorities are likely to misuse power ("Empowering authorities to define harmful speech risks abuse").  

3. Values and Norms  
   • The text assumes that free expression is a fundamental value, necessary for societal progress and democracy ("Free speech allows societies to grow through debate, fostering resilience and accountability").  
   • The metaphor of "slippery slope" is used to suggest that censorship leads to authoritarianism, a culturally specific warning about risk and governance.  
   • Norms of open dialogue and engagement are promoted as culturally superior strategies ("Open dialogue fosters critical thinking and innovation").  

4. Decision-Making Patterns  
   • Decisions about harmful speech are depicted as fraught with power dynamics and potential bias, discouraging delegation to authorities ("Granting authorities the power to define harmful speech risks abuse").  
   • The text advocates for consensus through public debate, suggesting participatory decision-making ("Encouraging education and dialogue").  
   • Choices are justified by the necessity of maintaining democratic values and innovation ("Protecting free speech ensures accountability and societal resilience").  

5. Cultural and Institutional Markers  
   • Historical references to civil rights movements and authoritarian regimes are used to illustrate the dangers of censorship ("For instance, civil rights movements faced censorship under claims of 'societal protection'").  
   • Idioms like "sunlight is the best disinfectant" are used to culturally convey the power of transparency and open critique.  
   • Concepts of "free speech" and "democracy" are central, reflecting cultural and political ideals that may not translate directly into contexts where these are not prioritized.
