1. Agency Expression
   • Collective and institutional agency is articulated through discussions of "gizarte demokratikoak" (democratic societies) and "gizarte plural eta sendo bat" (a plural and robust society), which implies collective responsibility.
   • The pronoun "nork" (who) is used to question authority and decision-making regarding censorship, emphasizing the agency of those in power versus the general public.
   • The voice shifts from active (e.g., "Zentsura beharrezkoa izan daiteke" - "Censorship may be necessary") to passive (e.g., "iritzi legitimoak isilarazi ditzake" - "legitimate opinions can be silenced"), indicating where agency is deliberately obfuscated or decentralized.

2. Responsibility Framing
   • Responsibility is framed both as a technical necessity ("Zentsura beharrezkoa da soilik") and a moral obligation ("besteak babesteko"), with an emphasis on protecting society from harm.
   • Obligation and accountability are expressed through modal verbs like "behar" (must/need), indicating a duty to act under certain conditions.
   • Implicit assumptions about who must answer include those with political power ("nork erabakitzen du" - "who decides") and the broader community tasked with maintaining democratic values.

3. Values and Norms
   • Ethical and social values asserted include the protection of "hitz egiteko askatasuna" (freedom of speech) and the prevention of "gorrotoa eta indarkeria" (hate and violence).
   • Terms like "eztabaida eraikitzailea" (constructive debate) and "gizarte anitza eta demokratikoa" (diverse and democratic society) reflect ideals of open discourse and inclusivity.
   • These values reveal community norms prioritizing dialogue and education over suppression, with a strong cultural emphasis on balance ("oreka") between freedom and security.

4. Decision-Making Patterns
   • Decisions are depicted as requiring consensus and careful consideration, with repeated calls for "balance" and "arrazionaltasun" (rationality).
   • Forms of participation include public discourse and education, suggesting a preference for collective engagement over hierarchical imposition.
   • Choices are justified on strategic grounds, as necessary to prevent specific harms like the spread of violence-inciting speech while preserving democratic health.

5. Cultural and Institutional Markers
   • Institutions implied include democratic governments and educational systems, though not explicitly named, their presence is felt through discussions of societal structures.
   • Context-bound expressions such as "eztabaida osasuntsua" (healthy debate) and "ideia kaltegarriak" (harmful ideas) highlight culturally specific understandings of discourse.
   • Concepts like "zentsura" (censorship) and "adierazpen askatasuna" (freedom of expression) are loaded with cultural and historical significance that may resist direct translation, reflecting local struggles with these issues.
